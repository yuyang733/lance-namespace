# CreateTableRequest

Request for creating a table, excluding the Arrow IPC stream. The table location and any credential vending behavior are determined by the implementation and returned in the response, rather than specified in this request. 

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**identity** | [**Identity**](Identity.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**context** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | Arbitrary context for a request as key-value pairs. How to use the context is custom to the specific implementation.  REST NAMESPACE ONLY Context entries are passed via HTTP headers using the naming convention &#x60;x-lance-ctx-&lt;key&gt;: &lt;value&gt;&#x60;. For example, a context entry &#x60;{\&quot;trace_id\&quot;: \&quot;abc123\&quot;}&#x60; would be sent as the header &#x60;x-lance-ctx-trace_id: abc123&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**id** | **List&lt;String&gt;** |  |  [optional] |
|**mode** | **String** | There are three modes when trying to create a table, to differentiate the behavior when a table of the same name already exists. Case insensitive, supports both PascalCase and snake_case. Valid values are:   * Create: the operation fails with 409.   * ExistOk: the operation succeeds and the existing table is kept.   * Overwrite: the existing table is dropped and a new table with this name is created.  |  [optional] |
|**properties** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | Business logic properties stored and managed by the namespace implementation outside Lance context, if supported by the implementation.  |  [optional] |
|**storageOptions** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | Storage options that configure overrides for writing table data and metadata during table creation. These are passed to Lance for the write path.  |  [optional] |
